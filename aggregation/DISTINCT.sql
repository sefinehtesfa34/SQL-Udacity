DISTINCT --is always used in SELECT statements, and it provides the unique rows for all columns written in the SELECT statement. 
-- Therefore, you only use DISTINCT once in any particular SELECT statement.
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3
FROM table1;

You would not write:

SELECT DISTINCT column1, DISTINCT column2, DISTINCT column3
FROM table1;

-- You can think of DISTINCT the same way you might think of the statement "unique".
